            <p className="mb-4">
                    The Custer Gallatin National Forest features riparian no-harvest buffers. It&apos;s your duty to recognize when you&apos;re near a stream or in a no-harvest zone. Several agencies collaborate to conserve and restore these zones. Restrict your firewood cutting to 150&apos; from water bodies. Trees and other vegetation play a crucial role in these areas; help us protect them.

            <p className="mb-4">
                    Cutting whitebark pine in the Custer Gallatin National Forest is forbidden. These trees, whether alive, dead, or fallen, are critical for both wildlife habitat and watershed protection. If uncertain about a tree&apos;s type, look for needles: whitebark pines have five per bundle, whereas lodgepole pines have two.

                <p className="mb-4">
                    Additionally, avoid cutting in active timber sales. The buyer owns all timber within the boundary, and cutting here is prohibited.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Estimating Firewood Quantity</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">How Do I Estimate the Number of Cords on My Load? • Firewood is commonly measured in cords. A standard cord is the amount of tightly piled wood in a stack, 4 feet high by 4 feet wide by 8 feet long. • 1 cord = 128 cubic feet - approximately 2,700 lbs. • To calculate the number of cords in a stack of wood, multiply the piles height by its width, and then by stick length (all in feet), then divide by 128.</p>
